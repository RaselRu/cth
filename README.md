# CTH - Static Version

This is a static version of the CTH (Community Tokens Hub) project, designed to work on GitHub Pages.

## About

This static version preserves the design and basic structure of the original PHP application but removes all server-side functionality:

- No database connection
- No user registration/login
- No real transactions
- All data is mock/static

## Deployment

The site is deployed to GitHub Pages at: https://raselru.github.io/cth

## Original Project

The original PHP version with full functionality is available in the same repository but requires PHP/MySQL hosting to run properly.
